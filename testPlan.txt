Testing: 
ttts.c
ttt.c

Setup: In order to test functionality we played a normal game of tic-tac-toe using the program. 
    - First we started the server on one computer by logging to ilab1@cs.rutgers.edu(or any other rutgers machine) and then compiled the ttts.c program. 
    - After that we ran the command "./ttts [port#]" replacing the port# with a port number that is avalible. 
    - Then the the other person, the one who didn't set up the server connection, logged onto another ilab machine and then ran "./ttt [domain name of 
      the host server][port#]"
    - Then the program will have matched us both togehter for a game
