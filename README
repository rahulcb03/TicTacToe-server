Project III: Tic-Tac-Toe | Rahul Badiani rb1217 & Suchit Kalluru srk170
Purpose: To create a on-line Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows players to join the server and be automatically matched to play a game

ttts.c - This is the code for the server of the game, it will control the game itself, communication with the client, and commuication with players. 
ttt.c - This is the client; it connects to the server, handles the reading from player actions from STDIN, and writing to the players with STDOUT. 


Implementation: 
ttt.c 

1) The program initially checks to make sure that the number of inputs that the user is supplying is suffiencet in order to actually connenct. It 
   takes the host and service that the user wants to connect to like so "./ttt [host] [port#]". 

2) Then there is a connection made using sockets in tandem with the 'connect_inet' function. The 'connect_inet' function takes in two parameters the [host]
   and the [port#] and returns a socket that is connected to the correct endpoints; this returend socket would be saved in a socket variable in the main function.
